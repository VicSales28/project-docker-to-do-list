# Docker To Do List 🐋

This project was developed while I was studying Docker at Trybe Programming School.

There is a full-stack application in this repository: a To Do List application! This application needed to be containerized to work. I developed the configuration files for each specific front: Front-end, Back-end and, in this case, for a test application that validates if the applications are communicating.

Inside the Docker folder, there are files called commandN.dc in the docker-commands directory, each N equals the number of the challenge I performed.

Each todo-app's Dockerfile was also developed by me, as well as the docker-compose.yml file.
